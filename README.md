# Real-Time-Weather-Application

This Weather Forecasting Web Application is a lightweight, browser-based tool designed to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather information for any city in the world. Built using core web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—the application integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather conditions. Users can input a city name to retrieve current weather details, along with a multi-day forecast that includes high/low temperatures and weather icons for better visualization. The application features a responsive and mobile-friendly interface, ensuring usability across a range of devices. JavaScript is used to handle API requests, parse JSON data, and dynamically update the DOM based on user interaction, while CSS provides a clean, intuitive layout with support for transitions and responsive grids. The project demonstrates fundamental frontend development skills such as event handling, API integration, asynchronous programming (via fetch), and conditional rendering. It also lays a foundation for implementing advanced features like unit conversion (Celsius/Fahrenheit), geolocation-based weather retrieval, and dark/light theme toggling. Ideal for learning how real-time APIs work in web applications, this project serves both as a hands-on development exercise and a useful utility tool. It can be easily extended or deployed using platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify. Future enhancements may include hourly forecasts, severe weather alerts, offline caching, or integration with machine learning models for prediction accuracy. With a focus on usability, performance, and scalability, this project exemplifies the practical application of web technologies in building real-world, data-driven applications. All code is organized into modular files, including index.html for structure, style.css for design, and script.js for logic. API keys are stored securely (with suggestions for .env usage in production), and the code follows best practices for readability and maintainability. This project not only fulfills academic requirements but also provides a strong starting point for developers exploring frontend integration with public APIs.
